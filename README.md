## üìñ Overview

<div align="center">

<sub>The AIME24 and AIME225 scores versus training steps of Skywork-OR1-32B in our multi-stage training pipeline.</sub>
</div>

The **`Skywork-OR1`** (Open Reasoner 1) model series consists of powerful math and code reasoning models trained using large-scale rule-based reinforcement learning with carefully designed datasets and training recipes. This series includes two general-purpose reasoning modelsl, **`Skywork-OR1-7B`** and **`Skywork-OR1-32B`**.

- **[`Skywork-OR1-32B`](https://huggingface.co/Skywork/Skywork-OR1-32B)** outperforms Deepseek-R1 and Qwen3-32B on math tasks (AIME24 and AIME25) and delivers comparable performance on coding tasks (LiveCodeBench).
- **[`Skywork-OR1-7B`](https://huggingface.co/Skywork/Skywork-OR1-7B)** exhibits competitive performance compared to similarly sized models in both math and coding scenarios.

## üìä Evaluation

We evaluate our models on AIME24, AIME25, and LiveCodeBench. Instead of using Pass@1, which is common in prior work, we introduce Avg@K as the primary metric. This metric robustly measures a model's average performance across K independent attempts, reducing the impact of randomness and enhancing the reliability of the results. We believe that Avg@K provides a better reflection of a model's stability and reasoning consistency.

We include the detailed results in the following table.

| Model                        | AIME24 (Avg@32) | AIME25 (Avg@32) | LiveCodeBench (8/1/24-2/1/25) (Avg@4) |

## üéØ Getting Started

### Installation

Docker environment:

```bash
docker pull whatcanyousee/verl:vemlp-th2.4.0-cu124-vllm0.6.3-ray2.10-te2.0-megatron0.11.0-v0.0.6

# Launch the desired Docker image:
docker run --runtime=nvidia -it --rm --shm-size="10g" --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN -v <image:tag>

# Inside the container, install Skywork-OR1
git clone https://github.com/SkyworkAI/Skywork-OR1.git && cd Skywork-OR1 && pip3 install -e .
```

Conda environment:

```bash
# Installing Python 3.10 Environment.
conda create -n verl python==3.10
conda activate verl

# Installing RLLM dependencies.
pip3 install torch==2.4.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
pip3 install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
git clone https://github.com/SkyworkAI/Skywork-OR1.git
cd Skywork-OR1
pip3 install -e .
```

### Training ‚öôÔ∏è

We provide training scripts and data to reproduce the results of the ‚ÄúSkywork-OR1-Series‚Äù.

### Training Data Preparation

To prepare the training data, we provide a script to download the data from Hugging Face and filter the problems based on the difficulty level with respect to a particular model (i.e., DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-{1.5,7,32}B).

```bash
model_size=32b  # 1p5b, 7b
python ./or1_scripts/data_preprocess/download_and_filter_data_${model_size}.py --local_dir ./or1_data/train
```

This will generate the training data in the following format:

```bash
./or1_data/train/train_${model_size}_math.pkl
./or1_data/train/train_${model_size}_code.pkl
```

### Train Script

By default, we only provide evaluation on AIME datasets. If you would like to evaluate on LiveCodeBench, please refer to the section [**Evaluation Data Preparation**](#evaluation-data-preparation)  and set `LIVECODEBENCH_DATA_PATH` to `./or1_data/eval/livecodebench/livecodebench_2408_2502`.

```bash
# Note: You must provide CODE_PATH and MODEL_PATH
model_size=7b # or 32b
train_seq_len=8 # or 16, 32
export CODE_PATH=./
export MODEL_PATH=
bash ./or1_scripts/train/${model_size}_${train_seq_len}k.sh
```

### Using Ray for Multi-Node Training

If you plan to perform **multi-node training**, you need to **start and connect all nodes using Ray** before launching the training script. Here's a quick guide to set up Ray across machines:

#### Step 1: Start Ray on the Head Node (node0)

On the first node (typically called `node0`), run:

```bash
ray start --head --dashboard-host=0.0.0.0
```

After running the command, you will see a message like:

```
Ray runtime started.
Next steps
To add another node to this Ray cluster, run
    ray start --address='10.94.16.4:6379'
```

Note down the IP address (in this example, `10.94.16.4`).

#### Step 2: Connect Other Nodes (e.g., node1)

On each additional worker node (e.g., `node1`), run the following, replacing the IP with that of your head node:

```bash
ray start --address='10.94.16.4:6379'
```

#### Step 3: Check Cluster Status

On `node0`, run:

```bash
ray status
```

You should see output showing all connected nodes and available resources (e.g., CPUs, GPUs, memory). For example:

```
Resources
---------------------------------------------------------------
Usage:
 0.0/360.0 CPU
 0.0/16.0 GPU
...
```

Once the Ray cluster is up and running, you can launch the training script as usual. The script will automatically utilize the connected nodes.

### Evaluation ‚öñÔ∏è

We provide evaluation scripts to reproduce the results of the `Skywork-OR1-Series`.

#### Evaluation Data Preparation

Evaluation data for AIME24 and AIME25 is already available in our GitHub repository.

For LiveCodeBench, please download the data from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Skywork/LiveCodeBench).

```bash
# Download LiveCodeBench
huggingface-cli download Skywork/LiveCodeBench --repo-type=dataset --local-dir ./or1_data/eval/livecodebench
unzip ./or1_data/eval/livecodebench/livecodebench.zip -d ./or1_data/eval/livecodebench/
mv ./or1_data/eval/livecodebench/livecodebench/* ./or1_data/eval/livecodebench/
```

#### Evaluation Start

```bash
bash ./or1_scripts/eval/eval_7b.sh

bash ./or1_scripts/eval/eval_32b.sh
```

The evaluation results will be automatically saved to [outputs/evalation/pass.csv](outputs/evalation/pass.csv)
